          <h5>How much Japanese should I know before using your site?</h5>
          <p>This is up to you, but we recommend that you have a solid understanding of basic grammar and that you know how to read ~500 kanji. That being said, if you're not quite there but would like a challenge, go ahead.</p>

          <h5>How do I sign up?</h5>
          <p>We're currently testing out the functionality of the site, so our user-base is invite only. However, if you'd <i>really</i> like early access to the site, shoot us an e-mail and we'll see what we can do.</p>
          <hr>
          <h5>How much does it cost to use your site?</h5>
          <p>Basic functionality will always be free, although we may add premium features down the line to cover the costs of operating the site.</p>

          <h5>I'm studying Japanese and I'm a developer. How can I help?</h5>
          <p>We're always looking for interesting people to join the project. Shoot us an e-mail with your background and we'll see if we can get you involved in some way, shape, or form.</p>
          <hr>
          <h5>Why did you create this site?</h5>
          <p>I experienced a problem finding Japanese reading material to practice with, so I wanted to help other Japanese learners deal with the same issue.</p>

          <p>After two years living in Japan, I could speak Japanese nearly fluently, but my vocabulary and reading skills left room for improvement. Unfortunately, I was in Japanese-learner purgatory, the point where I'd learned enough kanji to move past the beginner material, but not enough to comfortably read a newspaper or book without intense use of my Jisho.</p>

          <p>There are about 2000 characters that Japanese students need to learn before they can read a newspaper.</p>

          <p>For people learning their first 500 kanji, there exist a lot of practice material in beginner books. For people who know 1500+ kanji, they can pick up a newspaper or book and only use a dictionary as a reference every now and then.</p>

          <p>However, for people who have learned between 500-1500 kanji, any given article or book could be full of unfamiliar kanji. This makes finding consistently good reading material for practice quite a challenge.</p>

          <p>We scan various Japanese news sites on the web and then compare their articles with the kanji lessons in various popular textbooks. By doing this, we can give students a list of articles with a high ratio of readable kanji based upon their prior study.</p>

          <p>There will still be words the student doesn't know, but hopefully this makes things a bit more fun and less painstaking to learn.</p>

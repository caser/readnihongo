      <h2>Practice Reading with Real Japanese Articles</h2>

      <p>As an intermediate Japanese learner, it can be hard to find reading material with familiar kanji. Enter in the textbook you're using and we'll find real news articles containing the kanji you've learned.</p>

        <p>After two years living in Japan, I could speak nearly fluently, but my vocabulary and reading skills left room for improvement. Unfortunately, I was in Japanese-learner purgatory, the point where I'd learned enough kanji to move past the beginner material, but not enough to comfortably read a newspaper or book without intense use of my Jisho.</p>

        <p>There are about 2000 characters that Japanese students need to learn before they can read a newspaper.</p>

        <p>For people learning their first 500 kanji, there exist a lot of practice material in beginner books. For people who know 1500+ kanji, they can pick up a newspaper or book and only use a dictionary as a reference every now and then.</p>

        <p>However, for people who have learned between 500-1500 kanji, any given article or book could be full of unfamiliar kanji. This makes finding consistently good practice reading material quite a challenge.</p>

        <p>We scan various Japanese news sites on the web and then compare their articles with the kanji lessons in various popular textbooks. By doing this, we can give students a list of articles with a high ratio of readable kanji based upon their prior study. There will still be words the student doesn't know, but hopefully this makes things a bit more fun and less painstaking to learn.</p>
